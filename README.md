# dsa-practise

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice repository! This is a dedicated space for me to hone my problem-solving skills, implement various data structures, and practice algorithmic approaches.

## About This Repository

This repository serves as my personal journal for DSA journey. Here, you'll find:

* **Solutions to common DSA problems:** From platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, GeeksForGeeks, etc.
* **Implementations of core Data Structures:** Such as Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Hash Maps, Heaps, etc.
* **Algorithmic paradigms:** Including Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms, Backtracking, Divide and Conquer, etc.
* **Code in various languages:** Primarily focusing on python.
* **Explanations and thought processes:** Where appropriate, I'll include comments or separate markdown files explaining my approach, time/space complexity, and alternative solutions.

## Goals

My primary goals for this repository are:

* **Consistent Practice:** To regularly solve DSA problems and improve my coding fluency.
* **Deep Understanding:** To gain a thorough understanding of the underlying principles of data structures and algorithms.
* **Problem-Solving Skills:** To enhance my ability to break down complex problems and devise efficient solutions.
* **Interview Preparation:** To prepare effectively for technical interviews.
* **Knowledge Sharing:** To create a resource that might be helpful for others (and my future self!).
